**What we do**

Twin Kites LLC turns data into actionable insights. We specialize in data analytics and engineering, deploying cutting‑edge statistical and machine‑learning (AI) models including large language models (LLMs) and traditional statistical models.  

Our team streamlines and modernizes data pipelines so information flows reliably from source to insight, and we craft intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards that translate complex datasets into clear, actionable stories with a central focus on data ethics.

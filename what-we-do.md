### **What we do**

Twin Kites LLC turns data into actionable insights. We specialize in data analytics and engineering, deploying cutting‑edge statistical and machine‑learning (AI) models including large language models (LLMs) and traditional statistical models.  

Our team streamlines and modernizes data pipelines so information flows reliably from source to insight, and we craft intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards that translate complex datasets into clear, actionable stories with a central focus on data ethics.

### Why a kite? 
The white kite’s habit of hovering to gain a clear view mirrors Twin Kites’ ability to spot insights before diving into data work, and carefully thinking about the impact of our work on your organization. To hover, the kites uses both it's wings and tail, reflecting our firm’s blend of technical expertise (“wing”) and strategic guidance (“tail”). The bird’s sleek, minimalist nature aligns with Twin Kites’ focus on clean, intuitive visualizations and clearly documented code. Together, these traits make the kite a fitting symbol for the company’s agile, precise, and visually‑driven approach to solving your data problems.
